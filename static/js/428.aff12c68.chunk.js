My portion of this project focused on creating a dynamic home page with a filter function, search field and search result page. It utilises database queries to keep my EJS responsive, including alt text for accessibility, and dynamic links to connect to other parts of the page. To create the styling I used a combination of bootstrap and my own CSS. We created our own database based on an ERD we created to show relationships, and seeded  using a spreadsheet with formula to keep our data flexible.

The app accommodates a stream of consciousness workflow for the user - through automatic updates and persistent drop down selection.  All updates to the database are automatic and the user is empowered to switch between tabs  allowing for separation of concerns. They can re-order their story and map, create new characters and set a status. We focused on a non destructive design, where story data is added to campaign history, rather than deleted on completion. The API requests are handled through Axios, with  Node and Express back end. The front-end  layout uses tailwind, and the drag-and drop functionality uses the react-dnd library.
